- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nils-Tack
- 👀 I’m interested in contributing to a deeper understanding of how marine organisms interact with their fluid environments for use in bio-inspired applications. Ultimately, my goal is to translate this knowledge to real world applications in the areas of autonomous exploration and monitoring as well as experimental platforms.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying the role that animal-fluid interactions play in the context of propulsion, energy recapture and prey-predator relationships in a range of systems such as cruising fishes and invertebrates. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development and integration of bobotic devices to study animal movement.
- 📫 How to reach me: nils_tack@brown.edu
